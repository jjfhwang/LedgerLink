# LedgerLink: Secure & Streamlined Blockchain Data Integration

LedgerLink provides a robust and efficient Python library for interacting with various blockchain ledgers. It simplifies the process of retrieving, transforming, and analyzing blockchain data, enabling developers to build powerful applications with ease. LedgerLink is designed with modularity and extensibility in mind, allowing for seamless integration with different blockchain platforms and data sources. It acts as a bridge, abstracting away the complexities of blockchain communication and data formats, empowering users to focus on their core application logic.

The primary goal of LedgerLink is to reduce the barrier to entry for developers working with blockchain data. Currently, accessing and interpreting blockchain data often requires deep technical knowledge and significant development effort. LedgerLink offers a unified interface for interacting with multiple blockchains, including but not limited to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and potentially others through its extensible architecture. It handles the intricacies of connecting to blockchain nodes, querying data, and parsing the results into readily usable Python objects. This allows developers to quickly prototype, test, and deploy blockchain-integrated applications without needing to become blockchain protocol experts.

LedgerLink's value proposition lies in its ability to accelerate blockchain development, improve code maintainability, and reduce the risk of errors. By providing a standardized API and data model, LedgerLink ensures consistency across different blockchain interactions. The built-in error handling and data validation mechanisms enhance the reliability and security of applications built on top of the library. Furthermore, the modular design allows for easy updates and extensions, ensuring that LedgerLink remains compatible with the ever-evolving landscape of blockchain technology. The library also features caching mechanisms to optimize data retrieval performance, preventing unnecessary calls to blockchain nodes and improving overall application responsiveness.

## Key Features

*   **Multi-Blockchain Support:** LedgerLink supports interaction with multiple blockchain networks through configurable modules. Currently implements base classes that can be extended for Bitcoin and Ethereum.
*   **Data Abstraction Layer:** Provides a unified API for accessing blockchain data, abstracting away the complexities of different blockchain protocols. Returns data as native Python objects.
*   **Transaction Retrieval and Parsing:** Capable of retrieving transaction details (sender, recipient, amount, fee, block height, etc.) and parsing them into structured data formats. Uses appropriate RPC calls and decodes raw transaction data.
*   **Block Data Retrieval:** Allows retrieval of block information, including block hash, timestamp, miner, transaction list, and other relevant metadata. Supports pagination for handling large blocks.
*   **Address Balance Query:** Provides functions to query the balance of specific addresses on different blockchains, taking into account confirmed and unconfirmed transactions. Leverages blockchain explorers or RPC calls for balance retrieval.
*   **Caching Mechanism:** Implements a caching layer to minimize redundant blockchain queries and improve performance. Can be configured to use in-memory or persistent storage.
*   **Error Handling and Validation:** Includes comprehensive error handling and data validation to ensure data integrity and application stability. Raises specific exceptions for various error conditions.

## Technology Stack

*   **Python 3.7+:** The core programming language for LedgerLink.
*   **requests:** Used for making HTTP requests to blockchain APIs and explorers.
*   **cryptography:** Implemented for cryptographic operations, such as address validation.
*   **Flask (Optional):** Can be used to create an API wrapper for the library.
*   **Redis (Optional):** Used for persistent caching of blockchain data.
*   **pytest:** Used for unit testing and integration testing.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/LedgerLink.git
    cd LedgerLink

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**

    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows

3.  **Install Dependencies:**

    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Configuration

LedgerLink requires configuration through environment variables. These variables specify the connection details for the blockchain nodes or APIs you want to interact with. Example setup:

*   `BLOCKCHAIN_TYPE`: The type of blockchain. Currently only supports "Ethereum" and "Bitcoin".
*   `ETHEREUM_NODE_URL`: The URL of the Ethereum node (e.g., `https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/<YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID>`).
*   `BITCOIN_NODE_URL`: The URL of the Bitcoin node (e.g., `http://user:password@localhost:8332`).
*   `REDIS_HOST`: The hostname of the Redis server (e.g., `localhost`).
*   `REDIS_PORT`: The port number of the Redis server (e.g., `6379`).

These environment variables can be set using your operating system's environment variable settings or by creating a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.

Example `.env` file:

BLOCKCHAIN_TYPE=Ethereum
ETHEREUM_NODE_URL=https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/<YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID>
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379

You can load environment variables using a library like `python-dotenv`:

    from dotenv import load_dotenv
    import os

    load_dotenv()

    blockchain_type = os.getenv("BLOCKCHAIN_TYPE")
    ethereum_node_url = os.getenv("ETHEREUM_NODE_URL")

## Usage

Example usage for retrieving Ethereum block data:

    from ledgerlink.blockchain import BlockchainFactory

    # Ensure you have set the ETHEREUM_NODE_URL environment variable.
    blockchain = BlockchainFactory.create_blockchain("Ethereum")
    block = blockchain.get_block(block_number=1000000)
    print(block)

Example usage for retrieving Bitcoin transaction data:

    from ledgerlink.blockchain import BlockchainFactory

    # Ensure you have set the BITCOIN_NODE_URL environment variable.
    blockchain = BlockchainFactory.create_blockchain("Bitcoin")
    transaction = blockchain.get_transaction(transaction_id="<TRANSACTION_ID>")
    print(transaction)

Detailed API documentation will be available in the `docs/` directory (currently under development). The API provides methods for interacting with the blockchain ledger, including fetching blocks, transactions, and account balances.
